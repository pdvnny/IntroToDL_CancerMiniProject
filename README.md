# IntroToDL_CancerDetectionMiniProject

 This repo will be used to store and share files related to a mini-project that I am doing for an online course (COUERSERA: Intro to Deep Learning by Univ. of Colorado at Boulder). 


Created on July 1st, 2022

COURSERA: Introduciton to Deep Learning (offered by CU Boulder)
Week 3 - CNN Cancer Detection Kaggle Mini-Project

## Kaggle Competition Info

The Kaggle competition is called "Histopathologic Cancer Detection"

## Three Deliverables Required

1) a Jupyter Notebook (or other document, options listed) with ...

    - a description of the problem/data
    - exploratory data analysis (EDA) procedure
    - analysis (MODEL BUILDING AND TRAINING)
    - results
    - discussion & conclusions

2) A public project GitHub repository with your work
        
    - GitHub URL should be in the report/notebook

3) A screenshot of your position on the Kaggle compeition leaderboard

    - I will have to submit my code/notebook to the Kaggle compeition
    - It doesn't actually matter where I end up on the leaderboard, but I have to share where I placed.

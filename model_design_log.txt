(1) - (3) No notes; still trying to figure out what I am doing

(4) Controlled "batch_size" now... don't expect much improvement

	batch_size -> 100
	epochs -> 20
	number of pics -> 5000

	Results:
	- Validation accuracy never increased
	- Loss barely changed and accuracy never did

	Changes:
	- Decreasing the number of epochs
	- Decreasing the number of samples again -> NEED TO GO FOR QUANTITY NOT QUALITY

(5) Re-arranged the jupyter notebook ... basically re-ran the same model design

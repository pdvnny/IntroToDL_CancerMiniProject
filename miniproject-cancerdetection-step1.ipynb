Files are named with an image id. The train_labels.csv file provides the ground truth for the images in the train folder. You are predicting the labels for the images in the test folder. A positive label indicates that the center 32x32px region of a patch contains at least one pixel of tumor tissue. Tumor tissue in the outer region of the patch does not influence the label. This outer region is provided to enable fully-convolutional models that do not use zero-padding, to ensure consistent behavior when applied to a whole-slide image.\n\nThe original PCam dataset contains duplicate images due to its probabilistic sampling, however, the version presented on Kaggle does not contain duplicates. We have otherwise maintained the same data and splits as the PCam benchmark.\n\n___","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Imports","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\n\nprint(os.getcwd())\nos.listdir('/kaggle/input')\nos.listdir('/kaggle/input/histopathologic-cancer-detection')\n\nDATA_PATH='/kaggle/input/histopathologic-cancer-detection/'","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-07-13T21:51:59.961094Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-07-13T21:51:59.961513Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-07-13T21:51:59.970148Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-07-13T21:51:59.961481Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-07-13T21:51:59.969363Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":3,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport glob","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-07-13T21:57:10.395365Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-07-13T21:57:10.396572Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-07-13T21:57:10.400937Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-07-13T21:57:10.396531Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-07-13T21:57:10.399841Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":7,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Helper Functions","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def load_image_info():    \n    train_locs = glob.glob(\"/kaggle/input/histopathologic-cancer-detection/train/*.tif\")\n    test_locs = glob.glob(\"/kaggle/input/histopathologic-cancer-detection/test/*.tif\")\n    \n    num_train = len(train_locs)\n    num_test = len(test_locs)\n    \n    y_train = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/histopathologic-cancer-detection/train_labels.csv\", header=0)\n    \n    return train_locs, test_locs, y_train","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-07-13T21:56:58.822476Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-07-13T21:56:58.823057Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-07-13T21:56:58.831958Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-07-13T21:56:58.823008Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-07-13T21:56:58.830469Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":5,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Step 1 - Description of the data and problem\n\nFor this project, originally a Kaggle competition, the task is to identify images of cells that contain metastatic cancer. This is a binary classification task on images. If an image contains at least one pixel of tumor tissue within a specified region, it is given a positive label. The images are 96x96 pixels, but the specific region used to classify the images is the center 32x32 pixel region. The task is setup this way to enable fully-convolutional models that do not use padding.\n\nThe data for this task is provided as 96x96 images, which are small parts of larger images. Reading in the three color channels (RGB) for each pixel, this means there are 27,648 total features for each image: the three RGB channels for each pixel and 9,216 pixels. Each pixel is provided as three values from 0 to 255, representing the contribution of each RGB color channel.\n\nThere are 277,483 images provided for this task. The images are divided into 220,025 images for training, since the corresponding labels are provided, and 57,458 images without provided labels. For these test images, a model will try to correctly predict whether these images have (1) or do not have (0) metastatic cancer cells.\n\nSummary:\n* 96x96x3 dimensions for each image -> 27,648 features initially\n* 220,025 images in training set\n* TRAINING: 27648 features x 220,025 images","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Loading the data","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"training_images, testing_images, y_train = load_image_info()\n\ny_train.head(8)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-07-13T21:57:16.018385Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-07-13T21:57:16.018843Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-07-13T21:57:40.948548Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-07-13T21:57:16.018807Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-07-13T21:57:40.947283Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":8,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(\"Double checking the type of the 'id' of the images...\",\n      \"\\n\\n\",\n      y_train.loc[0,'id'],\n      \"\\n\\n\",\n      type(y_train.loc[0,'id']))","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-07-13T21:57:50.896207Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-07-13T21:57:50.896650Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-07-13T21:57:50.903020Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-07-13T21:57:50.896615Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-07-13T21:57:50.901909Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":10,"outputs":[]}]}

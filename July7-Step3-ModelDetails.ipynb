    "#### Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to limited time and computing resources, I'll stick to a simple model. I plan to use the \"building block-style\" Covolution-Convolution-Pooling design pattern with probably no more than 4 repetitions of this pattern. Since we previously experimented with the development of neural network architecture, I am hoping to replicate a reliable NN structure from one of the example image classification models from the videos. In theory, the key features will be extracted by the convolution architecture and the NN structure from another image classification task can be successfully optimized for new features.\n",

    "__Design parameters and Hyperparameters__\n",
    "Decisions\n",
    "* I will use ReLU (hidden layers) and sigmoid (output layer) as activation functions. This is not a design parameter that I plan to vary this time.\n",
    "* I will primarily use 3x3xd convolutional filters\n",
    "* As an optimization method, I will stick to SGD, which I am most familiar with, and plant to incorporate momentum if possible with the Keras API.\n",
